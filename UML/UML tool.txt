Things to Know
    Leaving Visual Paradigm open when not in use consumes a floating license and may prevent others from using Visual Paradigm.
    Leaving the "commit" dialog window open prevents other users on a particular project from committing changes.
    Some users have experienced workspace loss on their corporate laptops using Windows, which loses saved but not committed progress.  Commit often.
